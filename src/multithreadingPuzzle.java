//In this program, we have five philosophers sitting at a table, each with a fork on their left and right. The philosophers alternate between thinking and eating, but can only eat if they have both the left and right forks. To prevent deadlock, we ensure that each philosopher picks up the forks in a specific order: the philosopher with the highest index picks up the right fork first, while all others pick up the left fork first.
